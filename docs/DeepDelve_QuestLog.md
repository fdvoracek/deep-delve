# 🟢 DEEP DELVE — C++-First Quest Log

> The **C++-first** path: every system is a C++ class from Quest 1, with a thin **Blueprint subclass** that only assigns data (meshes, sounds, Data Assets, input assets) and sets `UPROPERTY` defaults. UMG uses C++ `UUserWidget` base classes with `meta=(BindWidget)` controls and `WBP_` layouts.
>
> **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5.8 · **IDE:** JetBrains Rider · **Art:** Synty POLYGON Dungeon Realms · **API macro used below:** `DEEPDELVE_API` (replace with your module's API macro).

## The working pattern (read once)

For every class we build:
1. **Write the C++ class** — `UPROPERTY` members expose data; specifiers decide who edits them (`EditDefaultsOnly` for class-default assets/tuning, `EditAnywhere` for per-instance, `VisibleAnywhere`/`BlueprintReadOnly` for runtime state, `BlueprintCallable`/`BlueprintNativeEvent` for BP access).
2. **Create a Blueprint subclass** (`BP_…` / `WBP_…`) — assign the values to those `UPROPERTY`s and drop the actor into the level.
3. **Data lives in `UPrimaryDataAsset`s** (`DA_…` instances) referenced by the classes.

Each quest lists: **📚 Teaches** (+ resources), **🎮 After this quest**, **💡 Why**, **🏛️ Patterns & principles**, **🔑 Key nodes / functions**, the **C++ classes & methods**, the matching **Blueprints**, a **UPROPERTY → value** table, **Steps**, and Milestone/Boss/Reward.

> **A note on recurring rules.** The code snippets show *what* to write, not boilerplate. A handful of habits recur in every quest — adding includes, creating components in the constructor, reaching the economy subsystem, and guarding editor-assignable references. Each is introduced (as a **📌 Rule from here on** box) in the quest where it *first* applies; once you've met it, apply it in every later quest without being reminded.

## 🏛️ Architecture & patterns you'll learn

This chain teaches *how to structure a game* as much as it teaches Unreal. Everything below is introduced in the quest noted and reused afterwards — so you finish able to name and apply each one.

**Clean-code & SOLID principles**
- **[Single Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)** — each class does one job: GameMode = rules, PlayerController = input/player, Subsystem = economy, Data Asset = data, Widget = view *(Q1+)*.
- **[Open/Closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)** — extend behaviour by adding classes, not editing existing ones *(Q6, the tech-effect hierarchy)*.
- **[Dependency Inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)** — depend on an interface, not a concrete type *(Q3, `IMineable`)*.
- **[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)** — write an action once and reuse it *(Q4/Q12 shared swing + damage-number path)*.
- **Unreal C++ hygiene** — Epic naming (`A`/`U`/`F`/`I`/`E`/`b`), `override`/`final`, const-correctness, forward declarations, null-guards. See the **[Epic C++ Coding Standard](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine)**.
- **Memory safety** — every UObject/actor reference held in C++ is a **`UPROPERTY()`** (usually a `TObjectPtr`) so the garbage collector tracks it and never frees it out from under you. See **[Unreal Object Handling](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-object-handling-in-unreal-engine)** and **[Object Pointers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/object-pointers-in-unreal-engine)** *(introduced Q3)*.

**Design patterns**
- **[Interface](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) (Dependency Inversion)** — `IMineable` *(Q3)*.
- **[Observer / pub-sub](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html)** — dynamic multicast delegates: `OnCoinsChanged`, `OnDamageDealt` *(Q4)*, `OnTechChanged` *(Q6)*, `OnCrewStatsChanged` *(Q13)*. ([pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer))
- **[Strategy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)** — polymorphic `UTechEffect` with a virtual `Apply()` *(Q6)*.
- **[Service Locator](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/service-locator.html)** — the `UGameInstanceSubsystem` reached via `GetSubsystem<>()` *(Q4)*.
- **[Type Object](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/type-object.html) / data-driven** — Data Assets define content without new code *(Q5)*.
- **Model–View separation** — C++ `UUserWidget` base + `WBP_` layout via `BindWidget` *(Q4/Q7)*.
- **[Update Method](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/update-method.html) vs Timers** — per-frame `Tick` only when needed (the collector, Q15); scheduled **[Gameplay Timers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-timers-in-unreal-engine)** for cadenced work (dwarves Q8, auto-swing Q12).
- **[Object Pool](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/object-pool.html)** — reuse spawned actors instead of constant spawn/destroy churn *(noted in Q4, applied as the Q17 optimization; see [UE performance considerations](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/common-memory-and-cpu-performance-considerations-in-unreal-engine))*.

# QUEST 1 — Foundations & First Class · ~60 min

**Goal.** Stand up a **C++** project, wire up Rider, migrate the Synty assets, compose the mine scene, and create your first C++ class — the GameMode — with its Blueprint.

📚 **Teaches:** setting up a C++ Unreal project with Rider, migrating assets between projects, and writing your first class — a Game Mode — with a Blueprint subclass.
**Resources:** [Game Mode & Game State](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/game-mode-and-game-state-in-unreal-engine) · [Gameplay Framework](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-framework-in-unreal-engine) · [Gameplay Classes (C++/BP)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-classes-in-unreal-engine) · [C++ Quick Start](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-cpp-quick-start) · [Epic C++ Coding Standard](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine) · *Further:* [Your First Hour in Unreal Engine](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/courses/3ke/your-first-hour-in-unreal-engine-5-2)

🎮 **After this quest:** the project compiles from Rider, your mine scene renders through a fixed camera, and your own `ADeepDelveGameMode` (via `BP_DeepDelveGameMode`) is the active game mode.

💡 **Why:** A [**Game Mode**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/game-mode-and-game-state-in-unreal-engine) is the session's rulebook — it decides *which* PlayerController, Pawn, HUD and GameState classes are spawned. Even a click game needs one so the engine spawns *our* controller (Q2). We extend **`AGameModeBase`** (the lightweight base) rather than `AGameMode` because Deep Delve is single-player.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:** **[Single Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)** — the GameMode owns *rules*, nothing else. The **C++-class + Blueprint-subclass split** ([Gameplay Classes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-classes-in-unreal-engine)) keeps behaviour in code and configuration in data. Follow the **[Epic C++ Coding Standard](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine)** from line one: `A`-prefixed actor classes, `override` on virtuals, one class per pair of `.h`/`.cpp` files.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `Games→Blank→C++ template · Tools→New C++ Class (GameModeBase) · Editor Preferences→Source Code Editor=Rider · Asset Actions→Migrate · Add→Camera Actor · Camera→Auto Activate for Player 0 · UE_LOG · Project Settings→Maps & Modes`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**Create `ADeepDelveGameMode : AGameModeBase`.**
```cpp
// DeepDelveGameMode.h
UCLASS()
class DEEPDELVE_API ADeepDelveGameMode : public AGameModeBase
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    ADeepDelveGameMode();
};
// .cpp
ADeepDelveGameMode::ADeepDelveGameMode()
{
    DefaultPawnClass = nullptr;  // click game — no pawn; PlayerControllerClass set in Q2's BP
}
```

### 🔵 Blueprint to create
- **`BP_DeepDelveGameMode`** (parent `ADeepDelveGameMode`). Set **Project Settings → Maps & Modes → Default GameMode = `BP_DeepDelveGameMode`** (and in the `Mine` map's World Settings).

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values
*(none this quest)*

### Steps
1. Install UE 5.8, **JetBrains Rider**, and the compiler toolchain (Windows: *Visual Studio Build Tools* C++ workload; macOS: Xcode command-line tools).
2. **New project → Games → Blank → C++**, Desktop, Starter Content off, name `DeepDelve`.
3. **Editor Preferences → Source Code → Source Code Editor = Rider**; build the empty project from Rider and confirm the editor opens.
4. **Migrate Synty:** open the Synty pack project, right-click its Content folder → **Asset Actions → Migrate** → choose your `DeepDelve/Content`.
5. Compose the `Mine` level (tiles + dwarf + light + a **Camera Actor**, *Auto Activate for Player 0*).
6. **Tools → New C++ Class → GameModeBase** → `DeepDelveGameMode`; paste; build. Create `BP_DeepDelveGameMode`; set it as the Default GameMode.

🏁 **Milestone:** clean compile from Rider; the `Mine` scene plays through the camera with your GameMode active.
🎁 **Reward:** Title **Prospector** · +100 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** you need the **Synty POLYGON Dungeon Realms** as a UE project — download/unzip the pack's Unreal project first, then Migrate *from* it. With `DefaultPawnClass = nullptr` there is no pawn, so the **auto-activated Camera Actor is your only view target**; a black viewport almost always means the camera isn't set to *Auto Activate for Player 0*. Make sure the floor/rock have collision so Q3's cursor trace has something to hit. 🗂️ **Organize by feature, not by asset type** — group content as `Mining/`, `Crew/`, `Economy/`, `UI/` (by game domain) rather than `Meshes/`, `Textures/`, `Blueprints/`; feature-based layout scales far better (Architecture Study Guide §8).

# QUEST 2 — The Player & Enhanced Input · ~55 min

**Goal.** Create the Player Controller (input) and a **Player State** (the player's `Damage` stat) in C++, and wire **Enhanced Input** in code so a left-click fires an `OnDig` handler.

📚 **Teaches:** Player Controllers, and wiring player input with the Enhanced Input system in C++.
**Resources:** [Gameplay Framework (Controllers)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-framework-in-unreal-engine) · [Player Controllers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/player-controllers-in-unreal-engine) · [Player State (Gameplay Framework)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-framework-in-unreal-engine) · [Enhanced Input](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/enhanced-input-in-unreal-engine) · *Further:* [Tom Looman — Unreal C++](https://tomlooman.com/)

🎮 **After this quest:** clicking logs a "dig" from your C++ controller; `Damage` lives on the **PlayerState** and the controller reads it via `GetPlayerState<>()`.

💡 **Why:** The [**PlayerController**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/player-controllers-in-unreal-engine) represents the player's *will* (input → commands) and persists independent of any pawn — the natural home for **input**, but **not** for stats. A player *stat* like `Damage` is an attribute of the player, not of input handling, so it belongs on the [**`APlayerState`**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-framework-in-unreal-engine) (Unreal's home for player attributes); the controller just *reads* it when it acts. [**Enhanced Input**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/enhanced-input-in-unreal-engine) is UE5's data-driven, remappable input system that replaces the legacy mappings.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:** **Single Responsibility** — the [**PlayerController**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/player-controllers-in-unreal-engine) owns *input/intent* ("swing now"); a player's *stats* (`Damage`) belong on the **`APlayerState`**, which is the framework's home for player attributes. Putting a stat on the input controller mixes two responsibilities — a common smell. (In a respawn/multiplayer game `PlayerState` also survives pawn death and replicates; here it holds the player's *live* stat while the persistent progression that feeds it lives in the economy subsystem, Q4/Q5.) Note the **forward declarations** (`class UInputMappingContext;`) in the header — declaring instead of `#include`-ing keeps compile times and header coupling down, a habit the [Coding Standard](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine) encourages.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `New C++ Class (PlayerController) · Build.cs: PublicDependencyModuleNames += "EnhancedInput" · ULocalPlayer::GetSubsystem<UEnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem> · AddMappingContext · UEnhancedInputComponent::BindAction · SetInputMode(FInputModeGameAndUI) · bShowMouseCursor`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**Create the stat holder — `ADeepDelvePlayerState : APlayerState`.** Player *attributes* like base `Damage` live here, **not** on the input controller.
```cpp
// DeepDelvePlayerState.h
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Stats") float Damage = 1.f;
float GetDamage() const;   // Q5 re-sources this from the equipped pickaxe; Q6 adds the tech bonus
// .cpp (Q2 version): float ADeepDelvePlayerState::GetDamage() const { return Damage; }
```
**Create `ADeepDelvePlayerController : APlayerController`** — *input only, holds no stats*:
```cpp
// header
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, Category="Input") TObjectPtr<UInputMappingContext> MiningContext;
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, Category="Input") TObjectPtr<UInputAction> DigAction;
virtual void BeginPlay() override;
virtual void SetupInputComponent() override;
void OnDig();
// .cpp
void ADeepDelvePlayerController::BeginPlay(){
    Super::BeginPlay(); bShowMouseCursor = true;
    if (auto* S = ULocalPlayer::GetSubsystem<UEnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem>(GetLocalPlayer()))
        if (MiningContext) S->AddMappingContext(MiningContext, 0);
    SetInputMode(FInputModeGameAndUI());
}
void ADeepDelvePlayerController::SetupInputComponent(){
    Super::SetupInputComponent();
    if (auto* EIC = Cast<UEnhancedInputComponent>(InputComponent))
        if (DigAction) EIC->BindAction(DigAction, ETriggerEvent::Triggered, this, &ADeepDelvePlayerController::OnDig);
}
// the controller asks the PlayerState for the stat — it never stores it:
void ADeepDelvePlayerController::OnDig(){
    if (auto* PS = GetPlayerState<ADeepDelvePlayerState>())
        UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Dig! %.0f"), PS->GetDamage()); // Q3 traces + damages
}
```
Add `"EnhancedInput"` to `PublicDependencyModuleNames` in `DeepDelve.Build.cs`. `MiningContext`/`DigAction` are `TObjectPtr` **`UPROPERTY`s**, so the GC keeps the assigned assets alive.

> **📌 Rule from here on — includes & Enhanced Input defaults.** Two habits you'll reuse in every later quest (stated once, here, where they first bite):
> - **Add an `#include` for every `U…`/`A…`/`F…` type you reference** — the snippets show *what* to write, not headers (Rider offers the fix). Here that's `EnhancedInputSubsystems.h`, `EnhancedInputComponent.h`, `InputMappingContext.h`, `InputAction.h`; and forward-declare `class UInputMappingContext; class UInputAction;` in the header.
> - **Enhanced Input must be the project default:** enable the *Enhanced Input* plugin and set **Project Settings → Engine → Input → Default Classes** to `EnhancedInputComponent` + `EnhancedPlayerInput`, or `Cast<UEnhancedInputComponent>(InputComponent)` is null and clicking logs nothing.

### 🔵 Blueprints to create
- **`BP_DeepDelvePlayerState`** (parent `ADeepDelvePlayerState`) — set **`BP_DeepDelveGameMode` → PlayerState Class = `BP_DeepDelvePlayerState`**.
- **`BP_MineController`** (parent `ADeepDelvePlayerController`). Create input assets **`IMC_Mining`** + **`IA_Dig`** (map `IA_Dig` → Left Mouse Button in `IMC_Mining`; add a **Pressed** trigger to `IA_Dig` so one click = one dig — without it, holding LMB fires `OnDig` every frame, i.e. hold-to-mine). Set **`BP_DeepDelveGameMode` → Player Controller Class = `BP_MineController`**.

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values
| Class | UPROPERTY | Assign |
|---|---|---|
| `BP_MineController` | `MiningContext` | `IMC_Mining` |
| `BP_MineController` | `DigAction` | `IA_Dig` |
| `BP_DeepDelvePlayerState` | `Damage` | `1.0` |

### Steps
1. New C++ class → **PlayerState** → `DeepDelvePlayerState` (holds `Damage` + `GetDamage()`); New C++ class → **PlayerController** → `DeepDelvePlayerController` (input only); paste; add `EnhancedInput` to `Build.cs`; **add the Enhanced Input includes + forward declarations (above); set the Default Input Classes in Project Settings**; build.
2. Create `IMC_Mining` + `IA_Dig`; map Left Mouse Button (with a Pressed trigger).
3. Create `BP_DeepDelvePlayerState` + `BP_MineController`; on `BP_DeepDelveGameMode` set both **PlayerState Class** and **Player Controller Class**; assign the table.
4. Play, click, watch the log read `Dig! 1`.

🏁 **Milestone:** left-click prints `Dig! 1` from C++.
🎁 **Reward:** Title **Pit Digger** · +150 XP.

# QUEST 3 — The Rock & the Interface · ~55 min

**Goal.** A reusable **`IMineable`** interface, the **`AOreVein`** actor that implements it, the controller's cursor trace that calls `MineHit`, and the first hit/break sounds.

📚 **Teaches:** C++ interfaces, Actors, decoupled damage through one shared interface, playing sounds — and the GC/`UPROPERTY` rule for object references.
**Resources:** [Actors](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/actors-in-unreal-engine) · [Interfaces](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprint-interface-in-unreal-engine) · [Unreal Object Handling (GC)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-object-handling-in-unreal-engine) · [Object Pointers (TObjectPtr)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/object-pointers-in-unreal-engine) · [Audio Engine Overview](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/audio-engine-overview-in-unreal-engine) · *Further:* [Actor Lifecycle](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-actor-lifecycle)

🎮 **After this quest:** clicking the rock damages it via the interface; at 0 HP it breaks (with sound) and a fresh rock spawns.

💡 **Why:** The rock is a spawnable, tickable world object → an [**Actor**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/actors-in-unreal-engine). The `IMineable` interface lets the caller deal damage without knowing the concrete type, so clicks now — and dwarves/auto-swing later — all use one `MineHit` call with zero extra coupling.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:**
- **[Dependency Inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) via an [Interface](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)** — the controller depends on the abstraction `IMineable`, not on `AOreVein`. This is the single most reused decision in the project; every future damage source rides it.
- **Memory safety / GC** — this quest introduces the first UObject references (`Mesh`, `HitSound`, `RespawnClass`). **Every one is a `UPROPERTY()`** so Unreal's garbage collector tracks it; a raw `USoundBase*` without `UPROPERTY()` can be collected and crash. See [Unreal Object Handling](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-object-handling-in-unreal-engine). Use `TObjectPtr<T>` for members (per [Object Pointers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/object-pointers-in-unreal-engine)).
- **`BlueprintNativeEvent`** — the interface method has a C++ default (`_Implementation`) and stays overridable in Blueprints.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `New C++ Class→Unreal Interface · UINTERFACE(BlueprintType) · BlueprintNativeEvent · MineHit_Implementation · GetHitResultUnderCursor(ECC_Visibility) · Implements<UMineable>() · Execute_MineHit · UGameplayStatics::PlaySound2D · SpawnActor/Destroy`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**Interface `UMineable`/`IMineable`:**
```cpp
UINTERFACE(BlueprintType) class UMineable : public UInterface { GENERATED_BODY() };
class IMineable { GENERATED_BODY()
public: UFUNCTION(BlueprintNativeEvent, BlueprintCallable, Category="Mining") void MineHit(float Amount); };  // NOT "TakeDamage" — AActor already has that
```
**`AOreVein : AActor, public IMineable`** — note every reference is a `UPROPERTY`/`TObjectPtr`:
```cpp
UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere) TObjectPtr<UStaticMeshComponent> Mesh;
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Rock") float MaxHP = 10.f;
UPROPERTY(VisibleInstanceOnly, BlueprintReadOnly, Category="Rock") float HP = 10.f;
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category="Rock|FX") TObjectPtr<USoundBase> HitSound, BreakSound;
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category="Rock") TSubclassOf<AOreVein> RespawnClass;
virtual void BeginPlay() override;                     // HP = MaxHP
virtual void MineHit_Implementation(float Amount) override;
// MineHit_Implementation: HP -= Amount; PlaySound2D(HitSound);
//   if (HP<=0){ PlaySound2D(BreakSound); SpawnActor<AOreVein>(RespawnClass, GetActorTransform()); Destroy(); }
```
**Update `ADeepDelvePlayerController::OnDig`:**
```cpp
FHitResult Hit;
if (GetHitResultUnderCursor(ECC_Visibility, false, Hit))
    if (AActor* A = Hit.GetActor()) if (A->Implements<UMineable>()){
        const float Dmg = GetPlayerState<ADeepDelvePlayerState>()->GetDamage(); // stat lives on the PlayerState (Q2)
        IMineable::Execute_MineHit(A, Dmg);
    }
```

> **📌 Rule from here on — components & guarding references.** Two habits every actor and quest reuses (stated once, here, where the first actor + first asset refs appear):
> - **Create components in the constructor.** A `UPROPERTY() TObjectPtr<U…Component> Foo;` is only a pointer; in the constructor do `Foo = CreateDefaultSubobject<U…Component>(TEXT("Foo"));` and set `RootComponent = Foo;` (or attach to the root). Skip it and the actor is invisible, has no collision, and `Foo->…` crashes. (`AOreVein::Mesh` is the first case.)
> - **Guard every editor-assignable reference and fail soft.** Any `UPROPERTY` pointing at an asset / class / Data Asset / effect (`TObjectPtr<>`, `TSubclassOf<>`, `Instanced`, resolved `TSoftObjectPtr`) can be left blank in the editor — null-check before dereferencing (`if (!Ref) { /* optional UE_LOG */ return; }`) and skip rather than crash (a packaged build has no console). `RespawnClass`/`HitSound`/`BreakSound` are the first such refs. (Unset Niagara/Sound refs are safe no-ops — no guard needed.)

### 🔵 Blueprint to create
- **`BP_OreVein`** (parent `AOreVein`); place in the `Mine` level. Import `S_RockHit`, `S_RockBreak`.

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values (on `BP_OreVein`)
| UPROPERTY | Assign |
|---|---|
| `Mesh` (component) | a Synty rock mesh |
| `MaxHP` | `10` |
| `HitSound` / `BreakSound` | `S_RockHit` / `S_RockBreak` |
| `RespawnClass` | `BP_OreVein` (itself) |

### Steps
1. New C++ class → Unreal Interface → `Mineable`; paste.
2. New C++ class → Actor → `OreVein` (add `public IMineable`); paste. **In the constructor create the mesh — `Mesh = CreateDefaultSubobject<UStaticMeshComponent>(TEXT("Mesh")); RootComponent = Mesh;`** — and add `#include "Kismet/GameplayStatics.h"` for `PlaySound2D`. Build.
3. Update `OnDig` to trace + `Execute_MineHit`.
4. Create `BP_OreVein`, assign the table, place it in the level.

🏁 **Milestone:** ten clicks break the rock (with sound) and a new one appears.
🎁 **Reward:** Title stays **Pit Digger** · +200 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** the rock needs collision the cursor trace can hit (default Synty mesh collision blocking Visibility is fine). Guard interface calls with `Implements<UMineable>()` so a mis-click on scenery is a no-op, not a crash. **Naming:** the interface method is deliberately called `MineHit`, **not** `TakeDamage` — `AActor` already has a built-in `TakeDamage`, and reusing that name causes hidden-function warnings. Every damage source (player, dwarves Q8, auto-swing Q12) calls `IMineable::Execute_MineHit`. **Sounds:** the Synty pack ships no `S_RockHit`/`S_RockBreak`; import any short SFX or use placeholders.

# QUEST 4 — Coins & the Economy Subsystem · ~60 min

**Goal.** A **`UGameInstanceSubsystem`** for the economy, a collectible **`ACoin`**, a C++ **HUD widget** with `BindWidget`, and floating damage numbers pushed through an event.

📚 **Teaches:** GameInstance Subsystems, the Observer pattern (event dispatchers), collectible Actors, C++ UMG widgets with BindWidget, and decoupling UI from gameplay.
**Resources:** [Programming Subsystems](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/programming-subsystems-in-unreal-engine) · [Event Dispatchers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/event-dispatchers-in-unreal-engine) · [Observer pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html) · [Service Locator pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/service-locator.html) · [UMG](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/creating-user-interfaces-with-umg-and-slate-in-unreal-engine) · [Widget Blueprints](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/widget-blueprints-in-umg-for-unreal-engine)

🎮 **After this quest:** broken rocks burst coins you sweep up (ching); a HUD shows Coins + Depth; a "1" floats off each hit.

💡 **Why:** Coins/Depth must survive level changes, so they belong to the [GameInstance's](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-framework-in-unreal-engine) lifetime — a [**Subsystem**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/programming-subsystems-in-unreal-engine) is the auto-created, globally-reachable home. Events push HUD updates only when values change. The HUD is a C++ `UUserWidget` with `BindWidget` for type-safe access.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:**
- **[Service Locator](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/service-locator.html)** — the economy is a Subsystem fetched with `GetGameInstance()->GetSubsystem<UMineEconomySubsystem>()`, giving one well-known instance instead of singletons or globals. It's also your **single source of truth** for game state.
- **[Observer / pub-sub](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer)** — the subsystem *broadcasts* `OnCoinsChanged` and `OnDamageDealt`; views subscribe. This is the key to **decoupling UI from gameplay**: gameplay code only *reports* facts and never touches widgets.
- **Model–View separation** — the C++ `UHUDWidget` holds logic; `WBP_HUD` holds layout, bound by name via `meta=(BindWidget)`.
- **[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)** — one `ReportDamage()` produces every floating number (clicks now, dwarves in Q8, crits in Q12).

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `UGameInstanceSubsystem · GetSubsystem<>() · DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE[_ThreeParams] + Broadcast · SimulatePhysics/AddImpulse · NotifyActorBeginCursorOver · bEnableMouseOverEvents · CreateWidget · meta=(BindWidget) · GetOwningPlayer()->ProjectWorldLocationToScreen · SetLifeSpan · Build.cs += UMG/Slate/SlateCore`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**`UMineEconomySubsystem : UGameInstanceSubsystem`** (no Blueprint — auto-instantiated):
```cpp
DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE(FOnCoinsChanged);
DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE_ThreeParams(FOnDamageDealt, FVector, WorldLocation, float, Amount, bool, bCrit);
UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly) double Coins = 0, Depth = 0;
UPROPERTY(BlueprintAssignable) FOnCoinsChanged OnCoinsChanged;
UPROPERTY(BlueprintAssignable) FOnDamageDealt OnDamageDealt;   // views subscribe; gameplay just reports
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) void AddCoins(double A);          // Coins+=A; OnCoinsChanged.Broadcast();
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) void AddDepth(double A);
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) void ReportDamage(FVector Where, float Amount, bool bCrit); // OnDamageDealt.Broadcast(...)
```
> **📌 Rule from here on — reaching the subsystem (`Econ`).** From an **Actor** *or* a **UserWidget**: `Econ = GetGameInstance()->GetSubsystem<UMineEconomySubsystem>();`. Cache it in a `UPROPERTY() TObjectPtr<UMineEconomySubsystem> Econ;` member set in `BeginPlay`/`NativeConstruct`, and guard `if (!Econ) return;`. Every `Econ->…` from here on assumes you did this once — the controller, HUD, ore vein, coins, dwarves and collector all reach the economy this way.
**`UMineStatics : UBlueprintFunctionLibrary`** — `UFUNCTION(BlueprintPure) static FText FormatNumber(double Value);` (1500 → "1.5K"; `FText` keeps it localizable).
**`ACoin : AActor`** — `UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere) TObjectPtr<UStaticMeshComponent> Mesh;` (**create it in the constructor and set as `RootComponent`**; Simulate Physics in BP); `int32 Value=1; float LaunchImpulse=300; float Lifespan=30;` `UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) TObjectPtr<USoundBase> PickupSound;` `BeginPlay` (random `AddImpulse`, `SetLifeSpan`); `NotifyActorBeginCursorOver` → `Collect()`; **`void Collect();`** (subsystem `AddCoins(Value)`; `PlaySound2D`; `Destroy`) — **keep `Collect()` public** (the collector reuses it in Q15).
**`UHUDWidget : UUserWidget`** — owns the damage-number view so gameplay stays UI-free:
```cpp
UPROPERTY(meta=(BindWidget)) TObjectPtr<class UTextBlock> CoinsText;
UPROPERTY(meta=(BindWidget)) TObjectPtr<class UTextBlock> DepthText;
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly) TSubclassOf<class UDamageNumberWidget> DamageNumberClass; // WBP_DamageNumber
virtual void NativeConstruct() override;   // Econ->OnCoinsChanged.AddDynamic(this, &::Refresh);
                                           // Econ->OnDamageDealt.AddDynamic(this, &::OnDamage);
UFUNCTION() void Refresh();                // CoinsText/DepthText via UMineStatics::FormatNumber
UFUNCTION() void OnDamage(FVector Where, float Amount, bool bCrit); // spawn a UDamageNumberWidget, Setup(Amount,bCrit), AddToViewport(), then SetPositionInViewport(ProjectWorldLocationToScreen(Where))
```
**`UDamageNumberWidget : UUserWidget`** — the floating-number view (this is what `DamageNumberClass` points at). `UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent) void Setup(float Amount, bool bCrit);` — the WBP reads `Amount`/`bCrit` to show the value and colour it (gold + bigger when `bCrit`). Without this `Setup` hook the spawned widget has no way to know what to display, so **you must add it** (the Q12 crit styling depends on it).
**Update `AOreVein`** — `UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) int32 CoinReward=10; UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) TSubclassOf<ACoin> CoinClass;` **cache `Econ` in `BeginPlay`** (per the rule above — the ore vein needs it too); the break branch loops `CoinReward`→`SpawnActor<ACoin>`, then `Econ->AddDepth(1)`.
**Update `ADeepDelvePlayerController`** — in `BeginPlay` set `bEnableMouseOverEvents=true` and create the HUD: `CreateWidget<UHUDWidget>(this, HUDClass)->AddToViewport();` (`UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly) TSubclassOf<UHUDWidget> HUDClass;`) — **`AddToViewport()` is required or the HUD exists but never shows.** `OnDig` **reports** the hit: after `Execute_MineHit(A, Dmg)`, call `Econ->ReportDamage(Hit.ImpactPoint, Dmg, false)` (`Dmg` from the PlayerState's `GetDamage()`, Q2) — the controller never spawns UI itself.

> **Build.cs:** the first `UUserWidget` (`UHUDWidget`) means adding **`"UMG"`, `"Slate"`, `"SlateCore"`** to `PublicDependencyModuleNames` — or nothing UMG-related compiles.

### 🔵 Blueprints to create
- **`BP_Coin`** (parent `ACoin`), **`WBP_HUD`** (parent `UHUDWidget`), **`WBP_DamageNumber`** (parent **`UDamageNumberWidget`**; float-up+fade animation, driven by the `Setup(Amount,bCrit)` event; **on the animation's Finished event call `Remove from Parent`** so numbers don't pile up in the viewport).

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values
| Class | UPROPERTY | Assign |
|---|---|---|
| `BP_Coin` | `Mesh` | Synty coin mesh; **Simulate Physics = true** |
| `BP_Coin` | `Value` / `PickupSound` | `1` / `S_CoinPickup` |
| `WBP_HUD` | `CoinsText`, `DepthText` | Text Blocks named exactly `CoinsText`/`DepthText` |
| `WBP_HUD` | `DamageNumberClass` | `WBP_DamageNumber` |
| `BP_MineController` | `HUDClass` | `WBP_HUD` |
| `BP_OreVein` | `CoinReward` / `CoinClass` | `10` / `BP_Coin` |

### Steps
1. Create the subsystem (with both delegates + `ReportDamage`), `UMineStatics`, `ACoin`, `UHUDWidget`; add `UMG`/`Slate`/`SlateCore` to `Build.cs`; build.
2. Update `AOreVein` (coin fields + spawn loop) and the controller (mouse-over + HUD + `ReportDamage`).
3. Create `BP_Coin`, `WBP_HUD` (match `BindWidget` names, assign `DamageNumberClass`), `WBP_DamageNumber`; assign the table.
4. Play; break rocks; collect coins.

🏁 **Milestone:** break → coins burst → hover to collect → HUD climbs, Depth ticks, damage numbers float.
🎁 **Reward:** Title **Miner** · +200 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** `BindWidget` requires the `WBP_HUD` widget names to **exactly match** the C++ members. Coins auto-clean via `SetLifeSpan`. **Create `ACoin`'s `Mesh` in the constructor (root)**, and **cache the subsystem once** (see the rule above; actors and widgets both use `GetGameInstance()`). Cursor-over on coins needs `bEnableMouseOverEvents` (set here) **and** coin collision that the cursor trace can hit. **Optimization to remember (Q17):** spawning/destroying many coins churns memory — an [Object Pool](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/object-pool.html) reuses them (see [UE performance considerations](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/common-memory-and-cpu-performance-considerations-in-unreal-engine)). Consider caching the subsystem pointer instead of re-fetching it each hit. 🏛️ **Architecture note:** this subsystem is your **single source of truth** — idiomatic and correct here — but mind its scope: as it later also spawns actors (Q6/Q8/Q15), saves (Q10), and pools coins (Q17), it trends toward a *god object*. Fine for a solo game; in a bigger one you'd split it into a **progression/state** subsystem, a world-scoped **spawn director** (a `UWorldSubsystem` or actor), and a **SaveManager** (Architecture Study Guide §7/§9).

# QUEST 5 — Data-Driven Content · ~50 min

**Goal.** Move rock and pickaxe stats into **`UPrimaryDataAsset`s**, and route the active rock/pickaxe through the subsystem so Descend (Q6) can swap tiers.

📚 **Teaches:** data-driven design with Data Assets (`UPrimaryDataAsset`) so content is authored, not coded.
**Resources:** [Data Assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/data-assets-in-unreal-engine) · [Type Object pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/type-object.html) · *Further:* [Data-Driven Gameplay Elements](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/data-driven-gameplay-elements-in-unreal-engine)

🎮 **After this quest:** identical to play, but a new rock/pickaxe is a new `DA_` asset — no recompile.

💡 **Why:** Hard-coding stats means every new rock is a code change. [**Data Assets**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/data-assets-in-unreal-engine) separate data from behavior; routing the active rock/pickaxe through the subsystem gives one source of truth the tech tree can change at runtime.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:** the **[Type Object pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/type-object.html)** — instead of a subclass per rock, one `AOreVein` reads its stats from a `URockData` "type" asset. Designers create content as data; the code stays fixed. This is the data-driven backbone the whole tech tree (Q6) builds on.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `UPrimaryDataAsset · right-click→Miscellaneous→Data Asset · TObjectPtr<> asset refs · SetStaticMesh · GetSubsystem`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**`URockData : UPrimaryDataAsset`** — `UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) TObjectPtr<UStaticMesh> Mesh; float MaxHP=10; int32 CoinReward=10;` (`MaxHP` is `float` to match `AOreVein::HP` and fractional crit damage; `CoinReward` stays an integer count)
**`UPickaxeData : UPrimaryDataAsset`** — `UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) TObjectPtr<UStaticMesh> Mesh; float Damage=1;` (no `Speed` field — swing cadence lives in `Econ->AutoSwingInterval`, Q12; don't add data nothing reads)
**Update `AOreVein`** — data-driven, seeded through the subsystem:
```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category="Rock") TObjectPtr<URockData> RockData; // starting tier (BP-assigned)
// BeginPlay:
//   auto* Econ = GetGameInstance()->GetSubsystem<UMineEconomySubsystem>();
//   if (!Econ->CurrentRock) Econ->CurrentRock = RockData;   // seed once
//   const URockData* A = Econ->CurrentRock;
//   Mesh->SetStaticMesh(A->Mesh); MaxHP=A->MaxHP; CoinReward=A->CoinReward; HP=MaxHP;
//   Econ->CurrentRockActor=this; Econ->OreVeinClass=GetClass(); Econ->LastRockTransform=GetActorTransform();
```
**Add to `UMineEconomySubsystem`** — all references are `UPROPERTY()` so the GC tracks them:
```cpp
UPROPERTY() TObjectPtr<URockData> CurrentRock;
UPROPERTY() TObjectPtr<AActor> CurrentRockActor;
UPROPERTY() TSubclassOf<AOreVein> OreVeinClass;
UPROPERTY() FTransform LastRockTransform;
UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly) TObjectPtr<UPickaxeData> EquippedPickaxe;
```
**Update `ADeepDelvePlayerController`:** `UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly) TObjectPtr<UPickaxeData> DefaultPickaxe;`. In `BeginPlay`, seed the subsystem once: `if(!Econ->EquippedPickaxe) Econ->EquippedPickaxe=DefaultPickaxe;`. `OnDig` already asks the PlayerState (`GetPlayerState<ADeepDelvePlayerState>()->GetDamage()`, Q2).
**Move the damage calc onto `ADeepDelvePlayerState::GetDamage()`** — it now *derives* from progression instead of a stored value: `return Econ->EquippedPickaxe ? Econ->EquippedPickaxe->Damage : 0.f;` (Q6 adds `+ Econ->PickaxeDamageBonus`). The starter `Damage` field from Q2 is superseded by the equipped pickaxe — delete it (or keep as an unarmed fallback). `APlayerState` is an actor, so it reaches the subsystem the usual way (cache `Econ` in its `BeginPlay`). This keeps the layering clean: **controller = input → PlayerState = the player's live stats → subsystem = persistent progression.**

### 🔵 Data Assets & Blueprint values
- `DA_CopperVein` (`URockData`: 10/10), `DA_IronVein` (25/30), `DA_StonePick` (`UPickaxeData`: Damage 1), `DA_SturdyPick` (Damage 3).

| Class | UPROPERTY | Assign |
|---|---|---|
| `BP_OreVein` | `RockData` | `DA_CopperVein` |
| `BP_MineController` | `DefaultPickaxe` | `DA_StonePick` |

### Steps
1. Create `URockData`, `UPickaxeData`; build; make the four `DA_` instances.
2. Add the subsystem fields (all `UPROPERTY()`); update `AOreVein::BeginPlay` and the controller's damage source.
3. Assign `RockData`/`DefaultPickaxe` in the BPs.
4. Prove it: point `RockData` at `DA_IronVein` → tougher/richer with no recompile.

🏁 **Milestone:** a new rock type + pickaxe added purely as `DA_` assets.
🎁 **Reward:** Title stays **Miner** · +200 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** `CurrentRockActor` is a `UPROPERTY()` `TObjectPtr` — when the rock is destroyed the GC auto-nulls it, so always guard with `IsValid(Econ->CurrentRockActor)` before using it (dwarves/auto-swing do this from Q8). Guard `Mesh->SetStaticMesh(A->Mesh)` against an unset `URockData.Mesh`, or the rock spawns invisible.

# QUEST 6 — Tech Tree: the Model · ~65 min

**Goal.** A data-driven tech tree with a **polymorphic `UTechEffect`** hierarchy driving every upgrade; all modifiers live on the economy subsystem.

📚 **Teaches:** a polymorphic `UObject` effect system (the Strategy pattern) and a data-driven tech-tree model that obeys the Open/Closed principle.
**Resources:** [Objects (UObject)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/objects-in-unreal-engine) · [Strategy pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy) · [Open/Closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle) · [Data Assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/data-assets-in-unreal-engine) · *Further:* [Incremental-game design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game)

🎮 **After this quest:** buy the first three nodes (temporary button): Sharpen → Iron Pickaxe → Descend — and descending swaps the rock.

💡 **Why:** Every upgrade does something different, but the tree shouldn't care. Each node owns a [**`UObject`**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/objects-in-unreal-engine) effect with a virtual `Apply()`, so adding an upgrade is adding a class, not editing a growing switch.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:**
- **[Strategy pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)** — each `UTechEffect` subclass encapsulates one interchangeable behaviour behind a common `Apply()` interface.
- **[Open/Closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)** — the tree is *open* to new effects (add a subclass) and *closed* to modification (no existing code changes). The Q6 boss check verifies exactly this.
- **Composition over inheritance** — a node *has-an* effect (instanced `UObject`) rather than the node hierarchy exploding into one subclass per upgrade.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `UCLASS(Abstract, EditInlineNew, DefaultToInstanced) · virtual Apply() · UPROPERTY(Instanced) · TMap · FMath::Pow · GetActorOfClass(ACameraActor) · AddActorWorldOffset · SpawnActor<AOreVein>`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**`UTechEffect : UObject`** (base):
```cpp
UCLASS(Abstract, EditInlineNew, DefaultToInstanced, BlueprintType)
class DEEPDELVE_API UTechEffect : public UObject { GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    UFUNCTION() virtual void Apply(class UMineEconomySubsystem* Econ, int32 NewLevel) {}
    // Stat effects (bonuses/mults) leave this true — safe to replay on load. State / side-effecting
    // effects (Descend, EquipPickaxe, HireCollector) override it to false; their result is restored
    // from the save instead of replayed. See Q10.
    virtual bool ReplayOnLoad() const { return true; }
};
```
**Subclasses:** `UTechEffect_UpgradePickaxeDamage` (`float AmountPerLevel=1;` → `Econ->PickaxeDamageBonus = AmountPerLevel * NewLevel`); `UTechEffect_EquipPickaxe` (`UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) TObjectPtr<UPickaxeData> Pickaxe;` → `Econ->EquippedPickaxe = Pickaxe`); `UTechEffect_Descend` (`UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) TObjectPtr<URockData> NextRock;` → `Econ->SetCurrentRock(NextRock)`).

**Two kinds of effect:** *stat* effects (like `UpgradePickaxeDamage`) write an **absolute** value from `NewLevel` (never `+=`) so they're correct on purchase *and* when replayed on load — leave `ReplayOnLoad()` `true`. *State / side-effecting* effects — **`EquipPickaxe`** (sets the equipped pickaxe) and **`Descend`** (destroys/spawns the rock actor and broadcasts `OnDescended`) — **override `ReplayOnLoad()` to return `false`**: replaying them on load would repeat the side effects and, because `NodeLevels` is an unordered `TMap`, could land you on the wrong tier. The save restores `CurrentRock`/`EquippedPickaxe` directly instead (Q10).
**`UTechNode : UPrimaryDataAsset`** — `FName NodeId; FText DisplayName, Description; TObjectPtr<UTexture2D> Icon; int32 Cost=10; float CostGrowth=1.15f; bool bRepeatable=false; int32 MaxLevel=1; TArray<TObjectPtr<UTechNode>> Prerequisites; FVector2D GridPosition; UPROPERTY(Instanced) TObjectPtr<UTechEffect> Effect;` (all `UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)`).
- ⚠️ **`NodeId` must be unique per asset** — it's the key for `NodeLevels` (and the save, Q10). Leave it `None` and *every* node shares one counter, so buying one node marks the others owned and their prereqs pass spuriously. (Alternatively key `NodeLevels` by the node's `FPrimaryAssetId`/asset path instead of a hand-set `FName`.)
- ⚠️ **`bRepeatable` nodes ignore `MaxLevel`** (buy indefinitely); only non-repeatable nodes are capped by `MaxLevel` (default `1`). Otherwise a repeatable upgrade maxes out after one purchase because `MaxLevel` defaults to `1`.
**Update `UMineEconomySubsystem`** (`EquippedPickaxe`, `CurrentRock`, `CurrentRockActor`, `OreVeinClass`, `LastRockTransform` exist from Q5, all `UPROPERTY()`):
```cpp
UPROPERTY() TMap<FName,int32> NodeLevels;
UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly) float PickaxeDamageBonus = 0.f;   // UpgradePickaxeDamage adds here
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) float DescendCameraStep = 150.f;       // read by the camera *listener*, not the subsystem
DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE(FOnTechChanged);
UPROPERTY(BlueprintAssignable) FOnTechChanged OnTechChanged;
DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE(FOnDescended);
UPROPERTY(BlueprintAssignable) FOnDescended OnDescended;        // Observer: a camera/view listener reacts to a descend

UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) int32 GetNodeLevel(UTechNode* Node) const; // NodeLevels.FindRef(Node->NodeId)
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) int32 GetCost(UTechNode* Node) const;   // Cost * CostGrowth^level
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) bool  CanBuy(UTechNode* Node) const;    // prereqs met · (Node->bRepeatable || level < MaxLevel) · Coins >= GetCost(Node)
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) bool  TryBuy(UTechNode* Node);          // AddCoins(-cost) [broadcasts OnCoinsChanged→HUD], ++level, Effect->Apply(this, level), OnTechChanged.Broadcast()
UFUNCTION() void SetCurrentRock(URockData* NewRock);                 // called by UTechEffect_Descend
```
`GetDamage()` (on the **`ADeepDelvePlayerState`**, Q2/Q5) now returns `EquippedPickaxe->Damage + PickaxeDamageBonus`.

**`SetCurrentRock` makes descending actually change the rock** — guard the actor pointer:
```cpp
void UMineEconomySubsystem::SetCurrentRock(URockData* NewRock)
{
    CurrentRock = NewRock;
    const FTransform Where = LastRockTransform;
    if (IsValid(CurrentRockActor)) CurrentRockActor->Destroy();     // guarded; GC nulls it after
    GetWorld()->SpawnActor<AOreVein>(OreVeinClass, Where);          // new rock reads CurrentRock in BeginPlay
    OnDescended.Broadcast();   // report the fact; a camera listener moves the view (the subsystem never touches the camera)
}
```

### 🔵 Data Assets (effects are inline on the node — no BP subclass)
- `DA_Node_Sharpen`, `DA_Node_IronPick`, `DA_Node_Descend`.

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values
| Data Asset | Field | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `DA_Node_Sharpen` | `NodeId`/`bRepeatable`/`Cost`/`Effect` | `Sharpen`/`true`/`10`/`UpgradePickaxeDamage(AmountPerLevel 1)` |
| `DA_Node_IronPick` | `NodeId`/`Prerequisites`/`Cost`/`Effect` | `IronPick`/`[Sharpen]`/`100`/`EquipPickaxe(DA_SturdyPick)` |
| `DA_Node_Descend` | `NodeId`/`Prerequisites`/`Cost`/`Effect` | `Descend`/`[IronPick]`/`250`/`Descend(DA_IronVein)` |
| each node | `NodeId` / `Icon` | a **unique** name / placeholder texture |

### Steps
1. New C++ class → Object → `TechEffect` (`Abstract, EditInlineNew, DefaultToInstanced`); add `virtual Apply`.
2. Add the three effect subclasses with params + `Apply` overrides.
3. New C++ class → PrimaryDataAsset → `TechNode`; mark `Effect` `Instanced`.
4. Extend the subsystem (`NodeLevels`, `PickaxeDamageBonus`, `OnTechChanged`, `GetCost/CanBuy/TryBuy`, `SetCurrentRock`).
5. Create the three `DA_Node_*`; set a **unique `NodeId`** on each, plus effects/prereqs/costs and `bRepeatable` (repeatable nodes ignore `MaxLevel`).
6. **Wire a temporary trigger to `TryBuy`** — the quickest is a debug key: add an `IA_DebugBuy` action to `IMC_Mining`, bind it in the controller, and call `Econ->TryBuy(SomeNode)` (or use a console command). It's throwaway — Q7 replaces it with the real tech-tree UI, so remove it then. Confirm the three nodes work (descend swaps the rock); build.

🏁 **Milestone:** buying the three nodes sharpens, equips, and descends to tougher/richer rock.
🎁 **Reward:** Title **Pit Foreman** · +300 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** mark `UTechEffect` `EditInlineNew`+`DefaultToInstanced` and the node's `Effect` `Instanced`, or you can't create effect objects inline on the Data Asset. `SetCurrentRock` **broadcasts `OnDescended`** instead of touching the camera — subscribe a listener (the controller, or a small camera actor) and, on `OnDescended`, nudge the Q1 camera down by `DescendCameraStep`. This keeps the rule *gameplay reports facts, views react* (Observer), so the subsystem needs no camera include and makes no "one camera" assumption. ⚖️ `CostGrowth` (~1.10–1.15) sets pacing; decide a rounding rule for `Cost * CostGrowth^level` (e.g. `FMath::RoundToInt`) so costs are stable. Expose tuning values as `EditAnywhere` so you balance without recompiling; tune after the demo. **Effect contract:** write *stat* `Apply`s as an **absolute** function of `NewLevel` (e.g. `Bonus = PerLevel * NewLevel`), not `+=` — `TryBuy` calls it once with the new level and Q10's load replays stat effects once per node, so an incrementing `Apply` would restore only one level after a reload. *State* effects (`Descend`, `EquipPickaxe`) instead return `false` from `ReplayOnLoad()` and are restored from the save. **Spend via `AddCoins(-cost)`** so `OnCoinsChanged` fires and the HUD coin counter updates on purchase (a bare `Coins -= cost` won't refresh it). 🏛️ **Scaling note:** `UTechEffect` + the subsystem's bonus fields are a *hand-rolled mini attribute/effect system*. In a larger game these graduate to the **Gameplay Ability System** — attributes on a `UAttributeSet`, changes applied through `GameplayEffect`s (see the Architecture Study Guide §9). Overkill for this scope, but the natural next step.

# QUEST 7 — Tech Tree: the UI · ~60 min

**Goal.** The real tech-tree screen from C++ `UUserWidget` bases + `WBP_` layouts.

📚 **Teaches:** building data-driven UMG screens in C++ — dynamic widgets on a Canvas with custom-drawn connectors.
**Resources:** [UMG](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/creating-user-interfaces-with-umg-and-slate-in-unreal-engine) · [Widget Blueprints](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/widget-blueprints-in-umg-for-unreal-engine) · *Further:* [UMG UI Designer Quick Start](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/umg-ui-designer-quick-start-guide-in-unreal-engine)

🎮 **After this quest:** a screen of connected nodes that light up when affordable and check off when bought.

💡 **Why:** Building the screen from the node data means the UI reflects the tree automatically. C++ holds the logic (buy/refresh/connectors); the WBP supplies the look — the same split as the HUD.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:** **Model–View separation** taken further — the widgets are pure *view*, reading from the `UTechNode` data (model) and the subsystem (state), and they refresh reactively off `OnTechChanged` (**Observer** again). No game rules live in the UI.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `UUserWidget · meta=(BindWidget) UButton/UImage/UTextBlock · UCanvasPanel · CreateWidget (in a loop) · UCanvasPanelSlot::SetPosition · NativePaint → UWidgetBlueprintLibrary::DrawLine · Button->OnClicked.AddDynamic · SetIsEnabled`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**`UTechNodeWidget : UUserWidget`** — `UPROPERTY(meta=(BindWidget)) TObjectPtr<UButton> BuyButton; TObjectPtr<UImage> IconImage; TObjectPtr<UTextBlock> NameText,CostText;` `UPROPERTY() TObjectPtr<UTechNode> Node;` `void Setup(UTechNode*)` (fill icon/name; `BuyButton->OnClicked.AddDynamic(this,&…::OnBuyClicked)`); `UFUNCTION() void OnBuyClicked()` (`Econ->TryBuy(Node)`); `UFUNCTION() void Refresh()` (colour by `CanBuy`/owned/maxed; `SetIsEnabled`).
**`UTechTreeWidget : UUserWidget`** — `UPROPERTY(meta=(BindWidget)) TObjectPtr<UCanvasPanel> Canvas;` `UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly) TSubclassOf<UTechNodeWidget> NodeWidgetClass; UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly) TArray<TObjectPtr<UTechNode>> AllNodes;` `NativeConstruct` (spawn a node widget per `AllNodes` at `GridPosition`; bind `OnTechChanged`→RefreshAll); `NativePaint` (draw connector lines from each node's Prerequisites).

### 🔵 Blueprints
- **`WBP_TechNode`** (widgets named `BuyButton`,`IconImage`,`NameText`,`CostText`), **`WBP_TechTree`** (Canvas named `Canvas`).

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values
| Widget | Field | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `WBP_TechTree` | `NodeWidgetClass` | `WBP_TechNode` |
| `WBP_TechTree` | `AllNodes` | `[DA_Node_Sharpen, DA_Node_IronPick, DA_Node_Descend]` |

### Steps
1. New UserWidget `TechNodeWidget` (BindWidget members + Setup/OnBuyClicked/Refresh).
2. New UserWidget `TechTreeWidget` (Canvas + NodeWidgetClass + AllNodes + NativeConstruct + NativePaint).
3. Create `WBP_TechNode` (matching names) + `WBP_TechTree` (Canvas named `Canvas`); assign the table.
4. **Show the tree from the controller:** add `UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly) TSubclassOf<UTechTreeWidget> TechTreeClass;` and an `IA_TechTree` input action (mapped to e.g. `T`) that creates the widget + `AddToViewport()` (and toggles/removes it on repeat). **Remove the Q6 temporary buy trigger now.** Build; buy nodes.

🏁 **Milestone:** the visual tree; click affordable nodes to buy.
🎁 **Reward:** Title stays **Pit Foreman** · +300 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** node `Icon` (`UTexture2D`) can be a placeholder or a mesh-captured thumbnail (empty icons on first run are expected, not a bug). **`AllNodes` is a hand-maintained array:** from here on, every new `DA_Node_*` you create (Q8, Q12, Q13, Q14, Q15) must be added to `WBP_TechTree.AllNodes` with a `GridPosition`, or the node never appears. The `NativePaint` connector lines are optional polish — if the canvas-slot geometry is fiddly, ship the node layout first and add connectors later.

# QUEST 8 — Hire the Crew · ~60 min

**Goal.** An animated `ADwarf` that mines the rock on a timer via `IMineable`, hired through a tech node.

📚 **Teaches:** spawning animated Actors, gameplay timers, and reusing a gameplay interface for autonomous behavior.
**Resources:** [Skeletal Mesh Animation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/animation-sequences-in-unreal-engine) · [Gameplay Timers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-timers-in-unreal-engine) · [Update Method vs timers](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/update-method.html) · [Interface reuse](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprint-interface-in-unreal-engine) · [Data Assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/data-assets-in-unreal-engine)

🎮 **After this quest:** buy "Hire Dwarf" → a dwarf appears and mines the rock on his own.

💡 **Why:** A dwarf is a visible, spawnable, animated Actor. He mines through the same `IMineable` interface your clicks use — the payoff of Q3: idle income needs no new coupling. A looping Timer drives the swing (fixed cadence, cheaper than per-frame Tick).

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:**
- **Dependency Inversion in action** — the dwarf deals damage via `IMineable::Execute_MineHit`, exactly like the player. Adding autonomous actors required *zero* changes to `AOreVein`.
- **[Update Method vs Timers](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/update-method.html)** — a swing is periodic, not per-frame, so a looping **[Gameplay Timer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-timers-in-unreal-engine)** is the right tool (leave `Tick` disabled). You'll contrast this with the collector's per-frame `Tick` in Q15.
- **Observer reuse** — the dwarf *reports* its damage via `Econ->ReportDamage(...)`; the HUD shows the number. The dwarf never touches UI.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `USkeletalMeshComponent · Anim asset / PlayAnimation · GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().SetTimer(handle, this, &..::Swing, Interval, true) · IsValid() · Execute_MineHit · Econ->ReportDamage · SpawnActor`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**`UMinerData : UPrimaryDataAsset`** — `UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) TObjectPtr<USkeletalMesh> Mesh; TObjectPtr<UAnimationAsset> MineAnim; float Damage; float SwingInterval;` (`SwingInterval` = **seconds per swing**, not a speed — higher = slower; used directly as the timer period)
**`ADwarf : AActor`** — every reference is a `UPROPERTY`:
```cpp
UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere) TObjectPtr<USkeletalMeshComponent> Mesh;
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) TObjectPtr<UMinerData> MinerData;
FTimerHandle SwingTimer;
virtual void BeginPlay() override;  // set mesh + play MineAnim; GetTimerManager().SetTimer(SwingTimer, this, &ADwarf::Swing, MinerData->SwingInterval, true)
void Swing();
// Swing(): auto* R = Econ->CurrentRockActor; if (!IsValid(R)) return;      // guard the respawn gap
//   const float Dmg = MinerData->Damage * Econ->CrewDamageMult;
//   IMineable::Execute_MineHit(R, Dmg); Econ->ReportDamage(R->GetActorLocation(), Dmg, false);
```
**`UTechEffect_HireMiner : UTechEffect`** — `UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) TObjectPtr<UMinerData> Miner; TSubclassOf<ADwarf> DwarfClass;` → `Econ->SpawnDwarf(DwarfClass, Miner)`. Like `HireCollector` (Q15), this **spawns an actor**, so **override `ReplayOnLoad()` to `false`** — Q10 rebuilds the crew from `HiredMiners`, and replaying the effect too would double-spawn dwarves on load.
**Update `UMineEconomySubsystem`** — `UPROPERTY() float CrewDamageMult = 1.f; UPROPERTY() TArray<TObjectPtr<UMinerData>> HiredMiners; UPROPERTY() TSubclassOf<ADwarf> DwarfClass;` and `void SpawnDwarf(TSubclassOf<ADwarf> Class, UMinerData* Miner)` — spawn on a ring around the rock (e.g. `Angle = HiredMiners.Num() * 45°; Offset = FVector(cos,sin,0) * Radius(~200)` relative to `LastRockTransform`) so dwarves don't stack inside the rock, **and record** `DwarfClass = Class; HiredMiners.Add(Miner);` so Q10 can rebuild the exact crew.

### 🔵 Blueprints / Data
- **`BP_Dwarf`** (parent `ADwarf`), **`DA_Dwarf1`** (`UMinerData`), **`DA_Node_HireDwarf`** (`UTechNode`, repeatable).

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values
| Asset | Field | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `DA_Dwarf1` | `Mesh`/`MineAnim`/`Damage`/`SwingInterval` | Synty dwarf mesh / mine anim / `1` / `1.0` (1s per swing) |
| `BP_Dwarf` | `MinerData` | `DA_Dwarf1` |
| `DA_Node_HireDwarf` | `Effect` | `HireMiner(Miner=DA_Dwarf1, DwarfClass=BP_Dwarf)` |

### Steps
1. New PrimaryDataAsset `MinerData`; New Actor `ADwarf`. **In the constructor create the skeletal mesh — `Mesh = CreateDefaultSubobject<USkeletalMeshComponent>(TEXT("Mesh")); RootComponent = Mesh;`** — then in `BeginPlay` set `Mesh->SetSkeletalMesh(MinerData->Mesh)`, `Mesh->PlayAnimation(MinerData->MineAnim, true)` (assign an `UAnimSequence` to `MineAnim`), start the timer, and `Swing` with the `IsValid` guard.
2. New `UTechEffect_HireMiner`; extend the subsystem (`CrewDamageMult`, `HiredMiners`, `DwarfClass`, `SpawnDwarf`).
3. Create `BP_Dwarf`, `DA_Dwarf1`, `DA_Node_HireDwarf`; assign values; **add `DA_Node_HireDwarf` to `WBP_TechTree.AllNodes` with a `GridPosition`** (or it won't show in the tree).
4. Build; buy Hire Dwarf; watch it mine.

🏁 **Milestone:** a hired dwarf mines hands-free.
🎁 **Reward:** Title **Master Smith** · +300 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** always `IsValid(Econ->CurrentRockActor)` before hitting it — between a rock breaking and its replacement's `BeginPlay`, the pointer is briefly null (the GC nulled the `UPROPERTY`). ⭐ *Optional:* deal damage on the exact swing frame with an [Anim Notify](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/animation-notifies-in-unreal-engine). 🏛️ Spawning from a `GameInstance` subsystem (`SpawnDwarf`, plus rock/collector spawns) works but is off-grain — spawning is world-scoped; in a larger project move it to a `UWorldSubsystem` or a small director actor (Architecture Study Guide §9).

# QUEST 9 — Menus & Level Flow · ~55 min

**Goal.** A Main Menu level and an Esc pause menu, driven by a C++ `UMenuWidget`.

📚 **Teaches:** level management (Open Level), UMG menus, input modes, and pausing.
**Resources:** [Gameplay Framework](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-framework-in-unreal-engine) · [Game Mode & Game State](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/game-mode-and-game-state-in-unreal-engine) · [UMG](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/creating-user-interfaces-with-umg-and-slate-in-unreal-engine)

🎮 **After this quest:** the game boots to a title screen (New Game / Quit); Esc pauses in the mine.

💡 **Why:** Splitting the title and game into levels keeps concerns apart; `OpenLevel` swaps them while the GameInstance (and economy subsystem) persists — which is why the economy lives there. The menu gets its own GameMode so the mining controller/HUD never run on the title screen.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:** **Separation of concerns across levels** — a dedicated menu GameMode means the menu never accidentally runs mining logic. It also demonstrates **lifetime scoping**: level-scoped actors reset on `OpenLevel`, while GameInstance-scoped state (your subsystem) survives — the reason New Game must *explicitly* `ResetToDefaults()`.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `UGameplayStatics::OpenLevel(FName) · UKismetSystemLibrary::QuitGame · SetInputMode(FInputModeUIOnly) · Set Game Paused · Level Blueprint BeginPlay · World Settings→GameMode Override · Game Default Map · IA_Pause`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**`UMenuWidget : UUserWidget`**
```cpp
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) void NewGame();     // Econ->ResetToDefaults(); UGameplayStatics::OpenLevel(this,"Mine")
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) void Continue();    // Q9: hidden/disabled (no save yet) — implemented in Q10
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) void Resume();      // pause menu only: Set Game Paused=false + RemoveFromParent()
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) void QuitToMenu();  // OpenLevel(this,"MainMenu") (no save/reset — Continue still reflects the last save)
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) void QuitGame();    // UKismetSystemLibrary::QuitGame(...)
```
**Update `ADeepDelvePlayerController`** — **create the `IA_Pause` input action, map it (Esc) inside `IMC_Mining`, and `BindAction` it in `SetupInputComponent`** (all three, or pause never fires); on it create/remove a pause widget, `SetInputMode`, `Set Game Paused`; expose `UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly) TSubclassOf<UMenuWidget> PauseMenuClass`.
**Main menu display (concrete owner):** give the **MainMenu level a GameMode Override = `BP_MenuGameMode`** (parent `AGameModeBase`, stock PlayerController) so the mining controller/HUD never run there; the MainMenu **Level Blueprint** on BeginPlay creates `WBP_MainMenu` → Add to Viewport → Set Input Mode UI Only → Show Mouse Cursor.
**Update `UMineEconomySubsystem`** — `void ResetToDefaults()` (clears Coins/Depth/NodeLevels/`HiredMiners`, resets multipliers and `CurrentRock`). The dwarf/collector *actors* are freed by the `OpenLevel` that `NewGame` calls right after — the subsystem keeps no spawned-actor refs, so don't rely on it to destroy them mid-level. ⚠️ **Extend this every time a later quest adds state** — crit fields (Q12), `CrewSpeedMult` (Q13), `CoinMult` (Q14), collectors/`CollectorSpeedMult` (Q15) — or New Game will carry stale values.

### 🔵 Blueprints / Levels
- **`WBP_MainMenu`**, **`WBP_PauseMenu`** (parent `UMenuWidget`), **`BP_MenuGameMode`** (parent `AGameModeBase`), a **MainMenu** level (World Settings → GameMode Override = `BP_MenuGameMode`). Set **Game Default Map = MainMenu**.

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values
| Asset | Field | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `BP_MineController` | `IA_Pause` / `PauseMenuClass` | `IA_Pause` (Esc) / `WBP_PauseMenu` |

### Steps
1. New UserWidget `UMenuWidget` with the four actions (Continue hidden for now).
2. Add `IA_Pause` + pause logic + `PauseMenuClass` to the controller; `ResetToDefaults` on the subsystem.
3. Create `WBP_MainMenu`, `WBP_PauseMenu`, `BP_MenuGameMode`, and the MainMenu level (GameMode Override + Level BP creates the menu).
4. Set Game Default Map = MainMenu; play from the menu → New Game → Esc pause.

🏁 **Milestone:** title → New Game → mine; Esc pauses/returns.
🎁 **Reward:** Title stays **Master Smith** · +250 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** the GameInstance persists across `OpenLevel`, so New Game must explicitly reset it. Leave the menu's **Continue button disabled/hidden until Q10** wires `HasSave()` — its `Continue()` is a stub here. The MainMenu Level Blueprint graph (BeginPlay → Create `WBP_MainMenu` → Add to Viewport → Set Input Mode UI Only → Show Mouse Cursor) is four nodes; build it exactly. Give `WBP_PauseMenu` a **Resume** button (calls `Resume()`); pressing Esc again should do the same.

# QUEST 10 — Save & Load · ~60 min

**Goal.** A `USaveGame` subclass + save/load in the subsystem that **reconstructs the world** (dwarves, tier, pickaxe).

📚 **Teaches:** the SaveGame system — serialization, soft object references, and rebuilding runtime state on load.
**Resources:** [Saving and Loading Your Game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/saving-and-loading-your-game-in-unreal-engine)

🎮 **After this quest:** quit, relaunch, Continue → coins, upgrades, depth, and dwarves are all exactly back.

💡 **Why:** [`USaveGame`](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/saving-and-loading-your-game-in-unreal-engine) is UE's built-in container for persistent progress, serialized to a slot on disk. Soft references keep a stable asset path resolved on load (no Asset Manager setup). Loading rebuilds the world because saving data isn't the same as recreating actors.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:** a lightweight **Memento** — the SaveGame captures the state needed to restore later, and `RebuildWorld()` reconstructs the runtime *actors* from that saved *data* (a clean separation of persistent state vs live objects). **Save versioning** (`SaveVersion` + defaulting missing fields) is a forward-compatibility habit worth keeping in every project.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `USaveGame · CreateSaveGameObject · SaveGameToSlot · DoesSaveGameExist · LoadGameFromSlot · DeleteGameInSlot · TSoftObjectPtr::LoadSynchronous · FDateTime::UtcNow · autosave timer`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**`UDeepDelveSaveGame : USaveGame`**
```cpp
UPROPERTY() int32 SaveVersion = 1;
UPROPERTY() double Coins = 0, Depth = 0;
UPROPERTY() TMap<FName,int32> NodeLevels;
UPROPERTY() TArray<TSoftObjectPtr<UMinerData>> HiredMiners;   // respawn the exact crew
UPROPERTY() TSoftObjectPtr<URockData> CurrentRock;
UPROPERTY() TSoftObjectPtr<UPickaxeData> EquippedPickaxe;
UPROPERTY() FDateTime LastSavedTime;
```
**Update `UMineEconomySubsystem`**
```cpp
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) void SaveGame();  // CreateSaveGameObject -> copy state -> SaveGameToSlot("DeepDelve",0)
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) void LoadGame();  // DoesSaveGameExist -> LoadGameFromSlot -> Cast -> copy -> RebuildWorld()
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) bool HasSave() const;
void RebuildWorld();  // 1) restore STATE from the save: CurrentRock/EquippedPickaxe via .LoadSynchronous(), place the rock ONCE
                      //    (do NOT replay Descend/EquipPickaxe — the save already holds the final tier/pickaxe);
                      // 2) for each HiredMiners: SpawnDwarf(DwarfClass, Miner.LoadSynchronous());
                      // 3) REPLAY only stat effects: for each NodeLevels entry, if (Effect->ReplayOnLoad()) Effect->Apply(this, level)
                      //    so PickaxeDamageBonus/mults/crit/bAutoSwing rebuild (absolute in level, per Q6);
                      // 4) Broadcast OnTechChanged/OnCoinsChanged/OnCrewStatsChanged
```
Wire `UMenuWidget::Continue` (enabled only if `HasSave()`) → `LoadGame` then `OpenLevel("Mine")`; make `NewGame` also `DeleteGameInSlot`. Add a repeating autosave timer.

### 🔵 Blueprints
- None new (the `USaveGame` subclass is used from C++). Wire the pause-menu Save/Load and menu Continue buttons to the C++ `UFUNCTION`s.

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values
*(none — save state is code; slot name is a constant)*

### Steps
1. New SaveGame class `UDeepDelveSaveGame` with the fields.
2. Add `SaveGame/LoadGame/HasSave/RebuildWorld` + the autosave timer to the subsystem.
3. Implement `RebuildWorld` (respawn crew from `HiredMiners`; resolve soft refs).
4. Wire pause-menu Save/Load and enable menu Continue (`HasSave`); `NewGame` deletes the slot.
5. Test quit → relaunch → Continue.

🏁 **Milestone:** relaunch → Continue → dwarves + depth restored.
🎁 **Reward:** Title stays **Master Smith** · +300 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** bump `SaveVersion` and default missing fields on load — Q13–16 add fields and old saves must not crash. `LoadSynchronous()` is fine here; for larger projects prefer async streaming to avoid a hitch. **Load: restore state, replay only stats.** `CurrentRock`/`EquippedPickaxe` are saved directly — restore them from the soft refs and place the rock **once**; do **not** replay `Descend`/`EquipPickaxe` (they have world side effects and `NodeLevels` is an unordered `TMap`, so replaying `Descend` can land you on the wrong tier with a drifted camera and stray rocks). Replay only the **stat** effects (`ReplayOnLoad()==true`) to rebuild `PickaxeDamageBonus`/mults/crit/`bAutoSwing` — otherwise a loaded game has the right node counts but zero bonuses. **Autosave timer:** start it in the subsystem's `Initialize()`, but note `GetWorld()` can be null that early — set the timer from the first `BeginPlay` of the mine (or check `GetWorld()` first). The subsystem's hard `HiredMiners` (`TObjectPtr`, Q8) copies to the save's soft `TSoftObjectPtr` list on save and back via `LoadSynchronous` on load. **Load edges to handle:** (1) resolve saved `NodeId`s through a registry of all `UTechNode`s (e.g. an `EditDefaultsOnly TArray<TObjectPtr<UTechNode>> AllTechNodes` on the subsystem, or the Asset Manager) and **skip any id with no matching node** — renamed/deleted nodes must not crash the load; (2) **guard every `LoadSynchronous()` result for null** before using it (a moved/removed asset resolves to null); (3) on a `SaveVersion` bump, **default new fields explicitly** (an old save with no `HiredCollectors` → `0`) instead of reading uninitialised data.

# QUEST 11 — Ship a Demo · ~45 min

**Goal.** Package the C++ build and send it to a friend.

📚 **Teaches:** packaging and distributing a standalone build.
**Resources:** [Packaging Your Project](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/packaging-your-project) · *Further:* [Packaging & Shipping](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/packaging-and-shipping-in-unreal-engine)

🎮 **After this quest:** a standalone Deep Delve demo a friend can run with no Unreal installed.

💡 **Why:** Shipping early gives real feedback and proves the loop runs outside the editor. Packaging produces a self-contained build; doing it now keeps any packaging issues small.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:** *ship early, iterate.* A vertical slice that runs standalone validates your whole architecture end-to-end (input → economy → save → package) far better than any amount of in-editor testing.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `Platforms→Windows→Package Project · Build Configuration: Development · Project Settings→Description (name/icon)`

### 🧩 C++ work
- None new. (A C++ project needs the toolchain to package; the packaged build is self-contained for players.)

### Steps
1. Confirm Game Default Map = MainMenu, project name/icon set. **Add both `MainMenu` and `Mine` to Project Settings → Packaging → "List of maps to include in a packaged build"** — levels loaded by name via `OpenLevel("Mine")` aren't auto-cooked, so a packaged build opens a black screen without this.
2. **Platforms → Windows → Package Project**, config **Development**.
3. Test the `.exe`: new game → upgrade → save → quit → relaunch → Continue.
4. Zip + share (Drive/WeTransfer).

🏁 **Milestone:** a shippable demo runs a full play/save/quit/continue cycle outside the editor.
🎁 **Reward:** Title stays **Master Smith** · +250 XP · 🎉
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** tune the economy (`Cost`/`CostGrowth` on the tech nodes) from your friend's feedback before adding content.

# QUEST 12 — Pickaxe Upgrades: Auto-Swing & Crits · ~55 min

**Goal.** New `UTechEffect` subclasses that add an auto-swing and critical hits, all routed through one swing path.

📚 **Teaches:** extending a system with new effect classes (no edits to old ones), randomness for crits, timers, and a single shared action path (DRY).
**Resources:** [Gameplay Timers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-timers-in-unreal-engine) · [Programming with C++](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/programming-with-cplusplus-in-unreal-engine) · [UMG Animation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/animating-umg-widgets-in-unreal-engine) · *Further:* [Incremental-game design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game)

🎮 **After this quest:** the pickaxe swings on its own and occasionally lands a gold "CRIT!".

💡 **Why:** Manual and auto swings must behave identically, so both funnel through one `PerformSwing()` rather than duplicating logic. RNG crits add variance; the auto-swing uses a looping Timer like the dwarves.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:**
- **[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)** — `PerformSwing()` is the *one* place a player swing happens (crit roll, damage, `ReportDamage`); the manual click and the auto-swing timer both call it. No copy-paste, no drift.
- **Open/Closed continued** — auto-swing and crits are new `UTechEffect` subclasses; nothing in Q6's tree code changes.
- **[Observer](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html)** — the auto-swing timer lives on the **controller** (SRP: it's the player's pickaxe), and the controller re-configures it by subscribing to the subsystem's `OnTechChanged` — so buying "Swing Speed" retunes the live timer without the subsystem knowing about the controller.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `GetTimerManager().SetTimer/ClearTimer (auto-swing, on the controller) · OnTechChanged.AddDynamic · FMath::FRand() (or FRandomStream) · Econ->ReportDamage · PlaySound2D`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**One swing path on the controller.** Move the manual-dig body into `ADeepDelvePlayerController::PerformSwing()`:
```cpp
void ADeepDelvePlayerController::PerformSwing(){
    AActor* R = Econ->CurrentRockActor; if (!IsValid(R)) return;
    auto* PS = GetPlayerState<ADeepDelvePlayerState>(); float Dmg = PS ? PS->GetDamage() : 0.f;  // stat on PlayerState (Q2)
    const bool bCrit = FMath::FRand() < Econ->CritChance;   // FRandomStream if you want reproducibility
    if (bCrit){ Dmg *= Econ->CritMultiplier; if (CritSound) UGameplayStatics::PlaySound2D(this, CritSound); }
    IMineable::Execute_MineHit(R, Dmg);
    Econ->ReportDamage(R->GetActorLocation(), Dmg, bCrit);
}
// OnDig just calls PerformSwing();  auto-swing timer also calls PerformSwing();
```
Add `UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) TObjectPtr<USoundBase> CritSound;` and a `FTimerHandle AutoSwingTimer;` on the controller. In `BeginPlay`, subscribe to `Econ->OnTechChanged` → a `ReconfigureAutoSwing()` that sets/clears the looping timer from `Econ->bAutoSwing` and `Econ->AutoSwingInterval`.
**Update `UMineEconomySubsystem`:** `UPROPERTY() bool bAutoSwing=false; UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) float AutoSwingInterval=1.f; UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) float CritChance=0.f; UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) float CritMultiplier=5.f;` (tunables are `EditAnywhere`).
**New `UTechEffect` subclasses:** `UnlockAutoSwing` (sets `bAutoSwing=true`), `UpgradeSwingSpeed`, `UnlockCrit`, `UpgradeCritChance`. Each writes the matching subsystem field (then `TryBuy` broadcasts `OnTechChanged`, which retunes the controller's timer). **`UnlockCrit` must seed a base chance** — `PerformSwing` gates crits purely on `CritChance`, so `UnlockCrit` does `Econ->CritChance = FMath::Max(Econ->CritChance, 0.05f)`; otherwise the unlock is a no-op until you also buy `UpgradeCritChance` (which adds `+5%`/level on top). **`UpgradeSwingSpeed` must clamp** — `AutoSwingInterval = FMath::Max(0.1f, BaseInterval - 0.1f * NewLevel)` — or enough levels drive the timer period to ≤0 (every-frame/undefined).

### 🔵 Blueprints / Data
- `DA_Node_AutoSwing`, `DA_Node_SwingSpeed`, `DA_Node_CritStrike`, `DA_Node_CritChance`. `WBP_DamageNumber` shows crits in gold/bigger, driven by the `bCrit` passed to its `Setup(Amount,bCrit)` (the `UDamageNumberWidget` from Q4 — if you skipped that hook, add it now). `BP_MineController → CritSound = S_Crit`.

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values
| Asset | Field | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `DA_Node_SwingSpeed` | `Effect` (repeatable) | `UpgradeSwingSpeed` (−0.1s/level) |
| `DA_Node_CritChance` | `Effect` (repeatable) | `UpgradeCritChance` (+5%/level) |
| `DA_Node_AutoSwing` | `Effect` / `bRepeatable` | `UnlockAutoSwing` / `false` (one-time, `MaxLevel 1`) |
| `DA_Node_CritStrike` | `Effect` / `bRepeatable` | `UnlockCrit` / `false` (one-time, `MaxLevel 1`) |
| `BP_MineController` | `CritSound` | `S_Crit` |

### Steps
1. Refactor `OnDig` → `PerformSwing()`.
2. Add the auto-swing/crit fields to the subsystem; on the controller add the timer + `ReconfigureAutoSwing()` bound to `OnTechChanged`.
3. Add crit roll + `CritSound` + `bCrit` reporting in `PerformSwing`.
4. New effect subclasses + `DA_Node_*`; build; buy them.

🏁 **Milestone:** hands-free swings + flashy crits.
🎁 **Reward:** Title **Deeplord** · +300 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** prefer a seeded `FRandomStream` over `FMath::FRand()` if you ever want reproducible runs for testing/balancing.

# QUEST 13 — The Growing Crew · ~50 min

**Goal.** Global crew multipliers that update live dwarves.

📚 **Teaches:** applying global modifiers live to many spawned actors via a broadcast event.
**Resources:** [Event Dispatchers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/event-dispatchers-in-unreal-engine) · [Observer pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html) · [Gameplay Timers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-timers-in-unreal-engine) · [Data Assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/data-assets-in-unreal-engine)

🎮 **After this quest:** buy a bigger, harder-hitting, faster crew; existing dwarves speed up at once.

💡 **Why:** One multiplier scales the whole crew, and broadcasting a change lets dwarves already in the world react (recompute + reset their timer) instead of being destroyed and respawned — the cheap, correct way to update many live actors.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:** **[Observer](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer) at scale** — one `OnCrewStatsChanged` broadcast updates N live dwarves without the subsystem holding references to them or looping/polling every frame. This is the idiomatic alternative to `Tick`-based scanning, and it composes with the timer-reset from Q8/Q12.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `float multipliers · DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE (OnCrewStatsChanged) · AddDynamic (in ADwarf::BeginPlay) · GetWorldTimerManager().ClearTimer + SetTimer (reset)`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**New effects:** `UpgradeCrewDamage`, `UpgradeCrewSpeed` → `Econ->CrewDamageMult` / `CrewSpeedMult`.
**Update `UMineEconomySubsystem`:** `UPROPERTY() float CrewSpeedMult=1.f;` + `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE(FOnCrewStatsChanged) OnCrewStatsChanged;` broadcast on change.
**Update `ADwarf`:** in `BeginPlay` bind `Econ->OnCrewStatsChanged` → **reset `SwingTimer`** with the new interval (`MinerData->SwingInterval / Econ->CrewSpeedMult`). (Damage needs no caching — `Swing` already reads `Econ->CrewDamageMult` live each swing.)

### 🔵 Data
- `DA_Node_CrewDamage`, `DA_Node_CrewSpeed`. Optional new `UMinerData` dwarf tiers + hire nodes.

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values
| Asset | Field | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `DA_Node_CrewDamage` | `Effect` (repeatable) | `UpgradeCrewDamage` (+0.25/level) |
| `DA_Node_CrewSpeed` | `Effect` (repeatable) | `UpgradeCrewSpeed` (+0.1/level) |

### Steps
1. Add `CrewDamageMult`/`CrewSpeedMult` + `OnCrewStatsChanged` to the subsystem.
2. New effect subclasses; `DA_Node_*`.
3. In `ADwarf::BeginPlay` bind the delegate → recompute + reset the timer.
4. Build; buy Crew Speed with several dwarves; all speed up.

🏁 **Milestone:** upgrades ramp all dwarves live.
🎁 **Reward:** Title stays **Deeplord** · +300 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** resetting a running `SwingTimer` mid-cycle (clear + re-set on `OnCrewStatsChanged`) can cause a visible hitch or a skipped/double swing; if it bothers you, preserve elapsed time or only apply the new rate on the next tick. Remember to add `CrewSpeedMult` to `ResetToDefaults` (Q9).

# QUEST 14 — Rich Veins · ~55 min

**Goal.** Yield upgrade, new vein tiers, and a lucky mineral drop.

📚 **Teaches:** scaling content through Data Assets + reused effects, and random reward drops.
**Resources:** [Data Assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/data-assets-in-unreal-engine) · [Type Object pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/type-object.html) · *Further:* [Incremental-game design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game)

🎮 **After this quest:** richer tiers as you descend, multiplied payouts, and occasional jackpot gems.

💡 **Why:** Because the effect system (Q6) and Data Assets already exist, new tiers + a yield upgrade are pure content — new assets and a reused `Descend` effect, no new systems. The lucky mineral is a rare drop: a jackpot, not steady income (keep the chance low).

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:** this quest is the **payoff of Open/Closed + Type Object** — a whole content expansion (more tiers, a new drop) with *almost no new code*. `AMineral : ACoin` also shows **inheritance for a genuine is-a** (a mineral *is* a collectible coin worth more) as a complement to the composition used for effects.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `float CoinMult · FMath::FRand() (mineral roll) · SpawnActor<ACoin>(MineralClass) · subclass ACoin · new UPrimaryDataAsset tiers · reuse UTechEffect_Descend`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**New effect:** `UTechEffect_UpgradeYield` → `Econ->CoinMult += Amount`.
**`AMineral : ACoin`** (inherits `Collect()`; higher `Value`, gem mesh); `BP_Mineral` parents **`AMineral`**.
**Update `AOreVein`:** apply `Econ->CoinMult` to the coin count; add `UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) float MineralChance=0.02f; int32 MineralValue=100; TSubclassOf<ACoin> MineralClass;` → on break, roll `MineralChance` → spawn a mineral. Add more `URockData` tiers + `UTechEffect_Descend` nodes.
**Update `UMineEconomySubsystem`:** `UPROPERTY() float CoinMult=1.f;`

### 🔵 Blueprints / Data
- **`BP_Mineral`** (parent `AMineral`). New `DA_` rock tiers (Silver/Gold/Mithril), `DA_Node_Yield`, `DA_Node_Descend_*`.

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values
| Asset | Field | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `BP_Mineral` | `Mesh`/`Value` | Synty gem mesh / `100` |
| `BP_OreVein` | `MineralClass`/`MineralChance` | `BP_Mineral` / `0.02` |

### Steps
1. New effect `UpgradeYield`; add `CoinMult` to the subsystem.
2. `BP_Mineral` (parent `ACoin`); add mineral fields + roll to `AOreVein`; apply `CoinMult` to coins.
3. Author new `DA_` rock tiers + Descend nodes.
4. Build; descend through tiers; confirm jackpots.

🏁 **Milestone:** richer tiers + jackpot gems.
🎁 **Reward:** Title stays **Deeplord** · +350 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** ⚖️ deeper tiers should raise `CoinReward` faster than `MaxHP`; keep `MineralChance` low (jackpot variance, not steady income). **Chain the new `DA_Node_Descend_*` via `Prerequisites`** (each descend requires the previous) so players can't skip tiers, and **add every new node to `WBP_TechTree.AllNodes`** with a `GridPosition`. Add `CoinMult` to `ResetToDefaults` (Q9). **Round the payout** — spawn `FMath::RoundToInt(CoinReward * Econ->CoinMult)` coins (pick round/floor once so payouts are stable). `UpgradeYield` is a stat effect (leave `ReplayOnLoad()` `true`); `AMineral` spawns are rare and stay outside the coin pool.

# QUEST 15 — The Coin Collector · ~55 min

**Goal.** A walking dwarf that auto-collects coins/minerals by overlap.

📚 **Teaches:** collision/overlap events and per-frame actor movement (Tick + delta time) — and when Tick is the *right* choice.
**Resources:** [Collision & Overlaps](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/collision-in-unreal-engine---overview) · [Actors (ticking)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/actors-in-unreal-engine) · [Update Method pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/update-method.html) · [Data Assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/data-assets-in-unreal-engine)

🎮 **After this quest:** a dwarf strolls across the mine hoovering up coins on its own.

💡 **Why:** Auto-collecting by touch is a collision/overlap query, not a click — an overlap fires when volumes intersect, exactly what a sweeper needs. The collector moves in `Tick`, scaled by delta time so speed is frame-rate independent. It reuses the coin's existing `Collect()`.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:**
- **[Update Method](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/update-method.html)** — continuous movement genuinely needs per-frame `Tick` (contrast Q8's timer for discrete swings). Scale by `DeltaSeconds` for frame-rate independence — a core real-time game principle.
- **DRY reuse** — the collector calls the *same* public `Collect()` from Q4; collection logic lives in one place.
- **Event-driven collision** — overlaps push notifications (Observer-like) instead of the collector polling every coin.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `USphereComponent · SetGenerateOverlapEvents(true) · OnComponentBeginOverlap.AddDynamic · Cast<ACoin> · Tick / GetDeltaSeconds · AddActorWorldOffset · PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick=true`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
**`ACollectorDwarf : AActor`**
```cpp
UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere) TObjectPtr<USkeletalMeshComponent> Mesh;
UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere) TObjectPtr<class USphereComponent> Reach; // Generate Overlap Events = true
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) float Speed = 200.f;
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) float LeftX, RightX;
// constructor: PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;
virtual void Tick(float Dt) override;   // move left by Speed*Dt*Econ->CollectorSpeedMult; wrap at LeftX
UFUNCTION() void OnReachOverlap(...);   // if (ACoin* C = Cast<ACoin>(Other)) C->Collect();
```
**New effects:** `UTechEffect_HireCollector`, `UTechEffect_UpgradeCollectorSpeed`. **Update subsystem:** `UPROPERTY() float CollectorSpeedMult=1.f;` plus a `SpawnCollector(TSubclassOf<ACollectorDwarf>)` that spawns the collector at `LeftX` (at the rock's Z) so it patrols across where coins land, and **records** `UPROPERTY() int32 HiredCollectors=0; UPROPERTY() TSubclassOf<ACollectorDwarf> CollectorClass;` (mirror of `SpawnDwarf`, Q8) so collectors can be rebuilt on load. `UTechEffect_HireCollector` spawns an actor, so it's a **state** effect — override `ReplayOnLoad()` to `false` (the Q10 rebuild loop respawns collectors from `HiredCollectors`; replaying the effect too would double them). `ACoin::Collect()` is already **public** (Q4).

### 🔵 Blueprints / Data
- **`BP_Collector`** (parent `ACollectorDwarf`), `DA_Node_HireCollector`, `DA_Node_CollectorSpeed`.

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values
| Asset | Field | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `BP_Collector` | `Mesh` / walk anim / `Speed` | Synty dwarf / walk anim / `200` |
| `BP_Collector` | `Reach` | Sphere, **Generate Overlap Events = true**, overlaps coins |

### Steps
1. New PrimaryDataAsset `CollectorData`; New Actor `ACollectorDwarf`. **In the constructor create both components — `Mesh = CreateDefaultSubobject<USkeletalMeshComponent>(...)` (root), `Reach = CreateDefaultSubobject<USphereComponent>(...)` (attached to root, Generate Overlap Events = true)** — and set `PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true`.
2. Tick moves left by `Speed*Dt*CollectorSpeedMult`; wrap at bounds.
3. `OnComponentBeginOverlap` → `Cast<ACoin>` → `Collect()`.
4. New effects + `DA_Node_*`; `BP_Collector`; build.

🏁 **Milestone:** the collector auto-sweeps coins.
🎁 **Reward:** Title stays **Deeplord** · +300 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** the constructor must create the components (root + sphere) and set `PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true` (or `Tick` never runs). Bind `OnComponentBeginOverlap.AddDynamic` on **`Reach` specifically** (not the mesh). Overlap needs **Generate Overlap Events = true on BOTH** the sphere and the coin — and since coins Simulate Physics (Q4), set the coin's collision to *overlap* the collector's object type (or give the sphere a custom trace/object channel the coin overlaps), or the begin-overlap never fires. **Persist collectors:** add `int32 HiredCollectors` to `UDeepDelveSaveGame` and a loop in Q10's `RebuildWorld` that calls `SpawnCollector(CollectorClass)` that many times (bump `SaveVersion`) — without it, purchased collectors vanish after Continue. Set the patrol `LeftX`/`RightX` in `BP_Collector`'s defaults to span the coin area.

# QUEST 16 — Deep Economy: New Upgrades & Balance · ~60 min

**Goal.** Round out the tech tree with a wave of new upgrades across every system — pickaxe, crew, economy/QoL, progression — then **tune the whole loop** so the curve feels good. The designer's pass.

📚 **Teaches:** the payoff of the data-driven effect system (add content as tiny classes + Data Assets, *zero* new systems) and **game-balance methodology** — reading and shaping an incremental's cost-vs-income curves.
**Resources:** [Incremental-game design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game) · [Open/Closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle) · [Data Assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/data-assets-in-unreal-engine) · *Further:* [Game balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_balance)

🎮 **After this quest:** a fuller upgrade screen and a loop that ramps smoothly — no dead ends, no runaway spikes, a satisfying "just one more" cadence.

💡 **Why:** every system now exists, so the fastest way to make Deep Delve *feel* like a real incremental is **breadth of choices + a tuned curve**. Because Q6's effects obey Open/Closed, each new upgrade is a small `UTechEffect` subclass + a `DA_Node_*` — no engine changes. And balancing is where an incremental is won or lost: the exponential of costs against the exponential of income sets the entire pacing.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:** **Open/Closed at scale** — a whole content wave with no edits to existing effects (the Q6 boss check, cashed in). **Single source of truth** — every new modifier lives on the subsystem, read live by gameplay. **Data-driven balancing** — costs/growth/amounts are `EditAnywhere`, so you tune in the editor (or a spreadsheet), no recompile.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `new UTechEffect subclasses · bRepeatable/MaxLevel/CostGrowth tuning · FMath::RoundToInt · TryBuyMax · a cadence timer for auto-actions · AllNodes layout`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods — new effects
All are **stat/flag writers** (absolute in `NewLevel`, `ReplayOnLoad()==true`), so save/load "just works". Add the matching field to `UMineEconomySubsystem` for each.

**Pickaxe depth**
- `UTechEffect_UpgradeCritDamage` → `Econ->CritMultiplier` (crit *damage*, complementing Q12's crit *chance*).
- `UTechEffect_UnlockCombo` + `UpgradeCombo` → a click **combo/heat** meter: consecutive manual swings ramp a temporary damage multiplier that decays when you stop (read in `PerformSwing`).

**Crew depth**
- `UTechEffect_UpgradeCrewCap` → `Econ->MaxCrew` (hire node checks it before `SpawnDwarf`).
- `UTechEffect_UnlockAutoHire` → `Econ->bAutoHireCrew` (a subsystem timer auto-buys the hire node when affordable).

**Economy & QoL**
- `UTechEffect_UnlockBuyMax` → `Econ->bBuyMax` (+ a `TryBuyMax(Node)` that buys every affordable level at once; the node widget uses it).
- `UTechEffect_UpgradeRefinery` → `Econ->MineralChanceBonus` / `MineralValueMult` (boosts the Q14 mineral drop).

**Progression**
- `UTechEffect_UnlockAutoDescend` → `Econ->bAutoDescend` (once a tier's depth threshold is met, auto-trigger the next `Descend` — reuses `SetCurrentRock`).
- `UTechEffect_UpgradeDepthBonus` → `Econ->DepthBonusPerLevel` (a global coin multiplier that scales with Depth reached).

`PerformSwing` reads the combo + crit-damage; `SpawnDwarf` respects `MaxCrew`; auto-hire/auto-descend run off a **cadence timer** (not per-frame). Guard the new `bUnlock…` flags on the crash path (ground-rule 5, Q3).

### 🔵 Data — new `DA_Node_*`
`DA_Node_CritDamage`, `DA_Node_Combo` · `DA_Node_CrewCap`, `DA_Node_AutoHire` · `DA_Node_BuyMax`, `DA_Node_Refinery` · `DA_Node_AutoDescend`, `DA_Node_DepthBonus`. Each needs a **unique `NodeId`**, prereqs wired into the existing tree, and a slot in `WBP_TechTree.AllNodes` with a `GridPosition` (Q6/Q7).

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values (a starting point — you'll tune these)
| Data Asset | `Cost` / `CostGrowth` / `bRepeatable` | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `DA_Node_CritDamage` | `500` / `1.18` / `true` | `UpgradeCritDamage` (+0.5× per level) |
| `DA_Node_Combo` | `750` / `—` / `false` | `UnlockCombo` (then `UpgradeCombo` repeatable) |
| `DA_Node_CrewCap` | `1000` / `1.5` / `true` | `UpgradeCrewCap` (+1 dwarf/level) |
| `DA_Node_AutoDescend` | `5000` / `—` / `false` | `UnlockAutoDescend` |
| `DA_Node_BuyMax` | `2500` / `—` / `false` | `UnlockBuyMax` (QoL) |

### ⚖️ The balancing pass (the real lesson)
- **Map the two curves.** Cost = `Cost * CostGrowth^level`; income = coins/sec from clicks + crew + collector × all mults. A healthy incremental keeps **time-to-next-upgrade roughly constant** (or gently rising). Pull a few values into a spreadsheet and watch that ratio.
- **Levers, by impact:** `CostGrowth` (pacing — keep ~1.10–1.15), base `Cost`, effect amount-per-level, each tier's `CoinReward` vs `MaxHP`, then `MineralChance`.
- **Symptoms → fix:** *walls* (progress stalls) → lower `CostGrowth` or raise income; *trivial/runaway* (buy everything at once) → raise `CostGrowth`/costs; *dead upgrades* (never worth it) → re-cost or buff the effect.
- **Method:** play to your deepest tier, note minutes-per-tier, change **one** lever, replay. Everything's `EditAnywhere`, so it's editor-only — no recompile (the reason Q5/Q6 made these data).

### Steps
1. Add the new effect subclasses (absolute in level, `ReplayOnLoad()==true`; the "Unlock…" ones set a bool) and their subsystem fields.
2. Read combo + crit-damage in `PerformSwing`; enforce `MaxCrew` in `SpawnDwarf`; add the auto-hire / auto-descend cadence timer and `TryBuyMax`.
3. Create the `DA_Node_*` (unique `NodeId`, prereqs, costs); add each to `AllNodes` with a grid position.
4. **Balance:** build a quick cost-vs-income table, tune `CostGrowth`/costs/amounts until minutes-per-tier is steady, then playtest to your deepest tier.

🏁 **Milestone:** a broad upgrade screen and a loop with no walls or runaway spikes — a steady "just one more".
🎁 **Reward:** Title stays **Deeplord** · +350 XP.
💡 **Notes & gotchas:** every new node still needs a unique `NodeId` + an `AllNodes` slot (Q6/Q7); auto-hire/auto-descend need a sane cadence (a timer, not per-frame); guard the new `bUnlock…` flags. All these effects are stat/flag writers → `ReplayOnLoad()==true`, so they restore correctly on load with no extra work.

# QUEST 17 — Strike It Rich · ~60 min · *finale*

**Goal.** Juice (animation, Niagara, Sound Cues), an **Object Pool** for coins, and a polished **Shipping** v1.0.

📚 **Teaches:** game "juice" — UMG animation, Niagara VFX, Sound Cues — the Object Pool optimization, and cutting a Shipping release.
**Resources:** [UMG Animation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/animating-umg-widgets-in-unreal-engine) · [Sound Cues](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/sound-cues-in-unreal-engine) · [Niagara VFX](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/getting-started-in-niagara-effects-for-unreal-engine) · [Object Pool pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/object-pool.html) · [UE performance considerations](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/common-memory-and-cpu-performance-considerations-in-unreal-engine) · [Packaging](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/packaging-your-project)

🎮 **After this quest:** a polished standalone v1.0 — clicks punch, coins ching, crits boom, dust and sparks fly, and hundreds of coins spawn without a hitch.

💡 **Why:** Juice is the feedback that makes actions feel good, cheap to add once systems work. And by now you're spawning/destroying lots of coins — the moment to introduce the [**Object Pool**](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/object-pool.html) so those allocations stop churning the GC.

🏛️ **Patterns & principles:**
- **[Object Pool](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/object-pool.html)** — keep a pool of inactive `ACoin`s and reuse them (hide/disable on collect, re-activate on spawn) instead of `SpawnActor`/`Destroy` each time. This is the canonical fix for spawn-heavy games; see [UE performance considerations](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/common-memory-and-cpu-performance-considerations-in-unreal-engine).
- **Polish as a separate layer** — VFX/SFX subscribe to the same events (`OnDamageDealt`, `OnCoinsChanged`) rather than being wired into gameplay, so juice never entangles logic.

🔑 **Key nodes / functions:** `Widget Animation (Designer) · Sound Cue asset · UNiagaraFunctionLibrary::SpawnSystemAtLocation · pooled ACoin (SetActorHiddenInGame/SetActorEnableCollision/reuse) · Build.cs += "Niagara" · Package Project (Shipping)`

### 🧩 C++ classes & methods
- Add `UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) TObjectPtr<class UNiagaraSystem> BreakVFX;` to `AOreVein` (plus crit sparks, mineral shimmer, coin poof); spawn via `UNiagaraFunctionLibrary::SpawnSystemAtLocation`. Add **`"Niagara"`** to `Build.cs`.
- **Object Pool:** give the subsystem a `UPROPERTY() TArray<TObjectPtr<ACoin>> CoinPool;` — `AcquireCoin()` reuses an inactive coin (or spawns one if the pool is empty) and `Collect()` returns it to the pool (hide + disable) instead of `Destroy()`. Optionally pre-warm ~50 coins at startup so the first big burst doesn't spawn a batch mid-frame.
- Optionally convert the raw `PlaySound2D` calls to **Sound Cues** (still `USoundBase` UPROPERTYs — assign a Sound Cue instead of a Sound Wave).

### 🔵 Blueprints
- Assign Niagara systems + Sound Cues on `BP_OreVein`/`BP_Coin`; author UMG animations (DIG punch, purchase pop, unlock flourish); Package Shipping.

### 🎛️ UPROPERTY → values
| Asset | Field | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `BP_OreVein` | `BreakVFX` | a Niagara dust burst |
| `BP_Coin` | `PickupSound` | `SC_CoinPickup` (Sound Cue) |

### Steps
1. UMG animations; Niagara bursts; ambient/music.
2. Add the coin **Object Pool** to the subsystem and route **all three** coin paths through it: (a) `AOreVein`/`AMineral` spawn → `AcquireCoin()` instead of `SpawnActor`; (b) `ACoin::Collect()` → return to the pool (hide, disable collision, stop physics) instead of `Destroy()`; (c) the Q15 collector still calls `Collect()`, which now recycles. On re-acquire, **reset** the coin (show, re-enable collision, clear velocity, re-apply launch impulse, **re-init `Mesh` + `Value` from the class defaults** so a recycled coin never keeps a mineral's gem look/value). **Drop the Q4 `SetLifeSpan` auto-destroy** — a pooled coin must never self-`Destroy` while parked, so replace lifespan with a timed *return-to-pool*; keep parked coins hidden + collision-off so the collector and cursor ignore them. `AMineral`s spawn via `MineralClass` (outside the pool); if you'd rather pool them, give minerals their own pool.
3. Set icon/splash/name; **Shipping** config; **Package**; test end-to-end; share.

🏁 **Milestone:** a polished, playable v1.0 outside the editor, smooth even with heavy coin spawns.
🎁 **Reward:** **Deeplord, Shaper of the Deep** · +400 XP · 🏅 QUEST LINE COMPLETE.

**🎓 What to learn next:** Gameplay Ability System (GAS), replication & multiplayer, and AI / Behavior Trees.
